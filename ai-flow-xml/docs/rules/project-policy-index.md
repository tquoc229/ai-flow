## Quick Start for AI Agents

**Before doing ANY work:**

1. ‚úÖ Check you have a PBI ‚Üí If NO, use `*create-pbi`
2. ‚úÖ Check PBI plan approved ‚Üí If NO, wait for user approval
3. ‚úÖ Check tasks created ‚Üí If NO, use `*decompose-tasks`
4. ‚úÖ Check task status = "Agreed" ‚Üí If NO, STOP
5. ‚úÖ Check NO other InProgress tasks ‚Üí If YES, STOP

**Ready?** Use `*execute-task` to implement.

---

## Core Principles

### Task-Driven Development
- **NO code changes without an agreed task**
- Every change must have explicit authorization
- All work traces back to a PBI

### User Authority
- User is the sole decider for scope and design
- User retains responsibility for all code changes

### Single Source of Truth
- Task detail file is authoritative for status
- Task index (`tasks.md`) is auto-generated
- Never edit task index manually

### Prohibited Actions
- ‚ùå NO changes outside task scope
- ‚ùå NO file creation without user confirmation
- ‚ùå NO gold plating or scope creep

---

## Critical Rules (MANDATORY)

1. **NO code changes without an agreed task**
2. **NO task creation without an associated PBI**
3. **ALWAYS update task status in the task file**
4. **ONLY ONE task InProgress per PBI at a time**
5. **ALL status changes must be logged in history**
6. **NO file creation without user confirmation**
7. **NO scope creep; stay within task boundaries**
8. **EVALUATE remaining tasks for obsolescence after each completion**

### When to HALT and Report

Stop immediately when:
- Multiple InProgress tasks found for same PBI
- Task is not in "Agreed" state
- Scope is expanding beyond task definition
- Tests are failing (in strict mode)
- Test expectation mismatch
- Dependencies unavailable (mark as "Blocked")

## Workflows Directory

For **step-by-step execution instructions**, see `workflows/` directory.

Each workflow is self-contained with:
- `workflow.yaml` - Configuration and variables
- `instructions.md` - XML-based execution guide
- `checklist.md` - Validation checklist (if applicable)
- `README.md` - Documentation

### Available Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Command |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **create-pbi** | Create PBI with Legacy Discovery and PRD | `*create-pbi` |
| **decompose-tasks** | Break down approved PBI into tasks | `*decompose-tasks` |
| **execute-task** | Implement task (Agreed ‚Üí InReview) | `*execute-task` |

**See:** `workflows/README.md` for complete workflow documentation.

---

## Policy vs Workflows

**Understanding the separation:**

| docs/rules/ | workflows/ |
|-------------|------------|
| **WHAT & WHY** | **HOW** |
| Policy reference | Execution guide |
| States, rules, principles | Step-by-step instructions |
| Quick lookup | Detailed workflows |
| ~1000 lines total | 200-400 lines per workflow |

**When to Load:**
- **Policy sections:** For reference, understanding rules, state definitions
- **Workflows:** When actually executing that workflow

**Benefits:**
- No duplication
- Optimized context loading (63% reduction)
- Clear separation of concerns

## Pre-Work Checklist (AI Agents)

Before starting ANY work:

```
[ ] Have associated PBI
[ ] PBI plan approved (status: ReadyForTasks or InProgress)
[ ] Tasks created and auto-approved (status: Agreed)
[ ] Task status confirmed in task detail file
[ ] No other InProgress tasks for this PBI (max_concurrent: 1)
[ ] All required files accessible
```

If ALL checked: Proceed with `*execute-task`

If ANY unchecked: STOP and resolve issue first

---

## Pre-Submission Checklist

Before marking task as InReview:

```
[ ] All task requirements implemented
[ ] All tests passing
[ ] Files Modified section accurate
[ ] Task status updated in task file
[ ] Task history logged with timestamps
[ ] Implementation notes appended
[ ] Validation checklist passed (95%+)
```

---

## Context Loading Strategy

**Startup (ALWAYS load):**
1. `AGENTS.md` - Primary directive
2. `ai-flow-config.yaml` - Configuration
3. `project-policy-index.md` (this file) - Overview

**On-Demand (load when needed):**
- Section 2 - When working with PBIs
- Section 3 - When working with tasks
- Section 4 - When implementing tests
- Section 5 - For quick reference
- Workflow files - When executing that workflow

**Token Efficiency:**
- Policy index: ~200 lines
- Specific section: 150-332 lines
- Workflow: 200-400 lines
- **Total context: 550-930 lines** (vs 3000+ monolithic)

- "How do I execute this?" ‚Üí Load workflow
- "What are the rules?" ‚Üí This index + relevant section

### For Humans

**Getting Started:**
1. Read this index completely
2. Skim Section 1 (Fundamentals)
3. Dive into specific sections as needed
4. Use Section 5 for daily reference

**Finding Information:**
- Use this index for navigation
